# Blog

My blog, created with [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog), with [gatsby-mdx](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx) for cooler looking posts.

All posts are found inside `content/blog/<year>/<post>`.

To play with, do:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/asg017/blogX.git
cd blogX/
yarn
yarn dev
```

Then http://localhost:8000 to see the posts, http://localhost:8000___graphql to play with the data.
