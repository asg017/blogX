This past Friday, the CSE Department at UC San Diego hosted a [Celebration of Diversity](http://csecelebration.ucsd.edu/), open to everyone, that had a series of talks, panels, and discussions centered around diversity and inclusion in CSE as a whole.

I didn't see too many undergrads at this event, so I wanted to write down some of my thoughts/experiences in case someone wanted to know more about it.

## TL;DR

- Celebration was cool and you should go to the next one, whenever it happens!
- Wasn't really focused on undergrads, was focused on CSE higher-ups
- I wish they talked about UCSD CSE specific issues more, and not CS as a whole
- I wish  there was more talk on race/economic issues



A few notes to consider about my experience:

- I didn't go to all the sessions, so the ones I missed may have been completely different.
- I've been to a lot of diversity-related events and programs before (mainly with Code2040), but I have NOT been to many academic-focused events (events where there are many professors and PhDs).
- I knew no-one going into this event. I didn't even know there was a DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) committee in the CSE department. I did see a few people I know at the event, but it wasn't like I walked in with a friend or something.
- I'm a cis-male, 4th year undergrad in the ECE department. Also, I'm usually shy and I don't talk to new people much.

## My Takeaways

### This celebration was for higher-ups in the CSE Department

As far as I could tell, the events and the talks were planned with CSE professors, academics, and people-in-power in mind. It seems that, in part, the purpose of the celebration was 1) Convince people that diversity is something that CSE should invest in, and 2) Teach people about the different topics, issues, and conversations relating diversity and inclusions at UC San Diego.

For example, the main topic of the keynote speech was "these are some reasons why women aren't in computer science." The "LGBTQ+ AT UCSD: RESOURCES AND COMMUNITY" event was, in, part, a "here's what the LGBT Resource Center has and what we do for students". 


Also, in the opening remarks, most of the stories centered around scenarios that mainly professors, researchers, or department heads go through. For example, how women get interrupted in academic talks. Or how unconscious bias may play a role in interviews. Or

What wasn't talked about as much? The classroom experience that undergrads go through everyday. Or admission processes. Or hackathons. Or project-based clubs and organizations. Or applying the internships or full-time opportunities. Or how employee resource groups (ERGs) work in a corporate setting.

Sure, they talked about issues effecting undergrads at a high level (the percentage of women studying CS), but that is just one aspect of the entire undergraduate experience.

There's nothing wrong with this approach - this is the first time that the CSE department has had an event centered around diversity that was open for everyone, and the CSE Diversity committee also seems pretty new. It seems that they wanted to have an event to kickstart their work and to convince higher ups (e.g. the CSE Chair, dean of Jacobs, etc.) that this was a topic people cared about.


### The people who went (and didn't go) to this celebration matters

I'm making broad assumptions here, but if I were to break up the people who came to this event, I'd put then in 3 categories:

1. People who are part of the CSE "establishment" (professors, department heads, tenured people, etc.)
2. People who are actively involved in the CSE DEI Committee
3. Regular students (undergrad, masters, PhD, etc.).

There was defintiely intersection between these groups - some undergrads are actively involed in the DEI Committee hosted events, some professors like Cosman and Alvarado are also involved in DEI events/research. It was also great seeing professors I've had in the past (who I've never need talk about DEI before) at the event, listening to everything and actively trying to learn. Or even just regular students like me who didn't know a DEO committee even existed come by and see what's up.

Also notice, who wasn't at this celebration - companies. This is rare for a CSE event - nearly tech event on campus I go to, there's *always* a Google or Qualcomm that throws money in hoping to get some new recruits or build connections.

I'd like to keep it this way. Nearly every tech company is absolute shit and diversity and inclusion, and I would hate if they came in to sponsor an event like this. CSE has more than enough money and resources to put on events like this, no need to bring in sponsors unnecessarily.


### Gender diversity was talked about a lot - other identities, not so much

In the opening remarks, there was much talk and stats about the percentage of women in CS (nationwide), but the conversation ended there. Once or twice, the term "under-represented minorities" was used, but specific numbers or stats weren't really available.

There wasn't much talk about intersectionality either. For example, stories or stats about women of color, or queer people of color, or low-income people of color were non-existant.

The exception to this was in the breakout sessions. In the workshop I went to about micro-aggressions, nearly all the scenarios in the activity we went through had elements of race, ability, or sexual orientation in them. In the talk about the LGBT Resource Center, people's experience of their sexual orientation, how other other identities (e.g. race/class) played a role in who they are and how they feel in their day-to-day lives.

And keep in mind, most of these breakout sessions were planned and put on by undergraduate students or grad/PhD students who are part of the CSE DEI committee - so props to them!

### UCSD CSE specific issues weren't really discussed

In Dr. Cosman's talk, there were graphics and numbers talking about the percentage of women earning computing bachelor degrees for the entire nation, but UCSD specific numbers were absent. Sometimes, whether in Cosman's talk or in another event, the speaker would say something like "oh UCSD has around 20% women in CS," but it was always hand-wavey and not exact.

This was kindof weird to me - I'm pretty sure most, if not all, of the attendees were UCSD people, and it was hosted at UCSD, so it would have been appropriate to show numbers about UCSD specifically. 

And it's not like the percentage of women in CS is the only relevant statistic that could've been talked about. For example, how many black/latinx CS students are studying computing at UC San Diego? How many women/underrepresented minorities are tutors in the CSE department? What is the racial breakdown of students who drop out of the CSE Department? How many veterans are enrolled in computing majors at UCSD? How many tranfer students are accepted into the CSE department every year? How are we different from other UC's or California universities?

Answers to these questions may not be very positive, and this was supposed to be a Celebration :tada:, but I think those types of UCSD-specific stats would have put everything in context a little better.

### Undergrads need to have more conversations about diversity and inclusivity
