## first

Hello! This is the (first?) post for my new blog. Like everything I do, I spent
waaaay to much time setting this site up for little added benefit, so the least
I can do it have my first post talk about the technical pieces behind this blog.

This is a Gatsby site, generated with the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)
recipe. Which is cool, I could just write a simple markdown file and be good to go!

But, markdown files by themselves are boring. The [internet isn't fun and weird
anymore](https://jarredsumner.com/codeblog/), so I added the [gatsby-mdx](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx)
plugin to allow for <Glitter>inline use of whatever</Glitter> React components
that I make up. File structure for each post is pretty simple, too - here's the
folder for this post:

```
content/blog/2019/sup/
├── components
│   ├── Glitter.js
│   └── Glitter.module.css
├── index.mdx
└── test_a.mdx
```

but `inline code` still works, right?

```
console.log("hello world")
```

<TestA />
