Hello! This is the (first?) post for my new blog. Like everything I do, I spent
waaaay to much time setting this site up for little added benefit, so the least
I can do it have my first post talk about the technical pieces behind this blog.

This is a Gatsby site, generated with the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)
recipe. Which is cool, I could just write a simple markdown file and be good to go!

But, markdown files by themselves are boring. The [internet isn't fun and weird
anymore](https://jarredsumner.com/codeblog/), so I added the [gatsby-mdx](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx)
plugin to allow for <Glitter>inline use of whatever</Glitter> React components
that I want. File structure for each post is pretty simple, too - here's the
folder for this post:

```
content/blog/2019/sup/
â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ Glitter.js
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Glitter.css
â”œâ”€â”€ index.mdx
â””â”€â”€ test_a.mdx
```

<SubPage />

ðŸ¤  pretty cool yo

A lot of the design choices/code comes from Dan Abramov's [overreacted.io blog](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io).

Basically, this should blog should be easier and more fun than making a blog
post with [Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/), but not as cool as
[codeblog.com](http://codeblog.com/) (whenever that is released).
