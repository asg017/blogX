# How to Survive as a UCSD CS Student with a Chromebook

It's back-to-school season, and you know what that means - dozens and dozens of forums posts, Facebook group posts, Reddit posts, all about one question - "What laptop should I get for school?".

And honestly, this _should_ be a re-occuring question. There are thousands of options, you invest hundreds or even thousands of dollars, and the tech landscape changes so fast that the options I had when I was a freshmen four years ago are very different than what's available now.

This post is about one of those options that _didn't_ exist before - Chromebooks. Chromebooks have been around for several years, but not until a few recently added features- notable Linux and Android support - have Chromebooks become a serious option for computer science students at UC San Diego (and probably other schools too). Personally, I have used a Chromebook as my main laptop for the past few years, as a Computer Engineering student at UCSD, and besides a few quirks, it has been great.

## Reminder - This is a "computer science student" perspective

Computer science classes at UCSD are much different than other majors - notably, other engineering majors. Other engineering classes typically require that you use hard-core engineering software - notably, Solidworks, Matlab, Autodesk tools, and a ton of other major-specific tools. Usually, these tools only support Windows and _somtimes_ Macs. Of course, most of these classes have alternatives to these (computer labs, borrow from a friend, etc.), but in most computer science classes, they don't require Windows-only or Mac-only tools (I'll talk more about this below). Just keep this in mind while reading this post!

## Don't Chromebooks suck?

Chromebooks _used to_ suck -

## How to make your Chromebook _Awesome_ (as a CS student)

## Things you CAN'T do with a Chromebooks

### Photo/Video Editing

### Gaming

### Have a lot of local files

Chromebooks don't have a lot of hard drive space - you're meant to keep most of your files in Google Drive. You could use an external hard drive or a micro SD card (if your Chromebook has a slot) for regular usage,

## Other alternatives

Since Chromebooks are much cheaper than other computers, you could use a Windows/Mac computer as your "main" and your Chromebook as your "side".

For example, for me, I've had an old Lenovo laptop since I was in high school - 2012! I had it most of high school and brought to college for my freshmen year. I could run any Windows software I wanted, it worked for all my classes - it was great!

But, like all 5+ year computers, it got really slow, the batteries died for a second time, I had to replace the hard drive, I spilled water on the keyboard (twice!). I wanted something new, but I didn't want to spend a ton of money. I also didn't want to just get a Chromebook - I still wanted Windows for a few classes and for a few apps I still used.

So I did both! I'd leave my old Windows laptop at home, and take my new and shiny Chromebook to school. It was much more lightweight, faster than my dying Windows laptop, and just easier to manage. Eventually, I just stopped using my Windows laptop, and used my Chromebook fulltime (and would only take my Windows laptop out whenever I _really really_ needed to use Excel).
