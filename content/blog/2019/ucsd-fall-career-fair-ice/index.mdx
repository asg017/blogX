Today, thousands of UCSD students will be attending the Fall Career Fair at RIMAC Arena, where nearly 190 employers from around the world will be stationed, talking to students, accepting resumes, and handing out free swag branded with their logos.

But, there is not much discussion about who these companies are and what they stand for. So, I have compiled a list of companies that are attending the Fall Career Fair that are working with Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) in some capacity.

**Note**: If there is anything I should add below, or if there is anything wrong in the information below, please let me know!

## Caveats

Just because a company is listed doesn't mean that they support family separation or that they actively participant in the crisis. But, they do have a working relationship with ICE, the organization that *does* separate children and lives, and in many cases, ICE wouldn't be able to function without tools provided by these companies. Many of these companies have also acknowledge their involvement with ICE and have refused to change their ways in the future.

## The Companies

### Accenture 

Accenture is a management consulting company that, [in 2018](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/11/675923576/customs-border-and-protection-paid-a-firm-13-6-million-to-hire-recruits-it-hired), was given $13.6 million by U.S. Customs And Border Protection to recruit thousands of applicant's to satisfy Trump's "mandate to secure the southern border." They were able to get hire 2 people, then [CBP cancelled the contract](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/05/politics/cbp-terminate-hiring-contract-accenture/index.html).

## Q&A

### What should I do with this information?

It depends. If you were planning to talk to these companies at the career fair, I would do some more research on their involvement with ICE, and decide on your own accord if you are comfortable with working with them.

If you weren't going to talk with them, I'd still take a closer look at the companies you *do* talk to. This isn't a complete list, and there may be other reasons to avoid working with a company.

### Why just companies that work with ICE?

There are many, many reasons to take a closer look at companies that you want to interview forâ€Š-â€Štheir working relationship with ICE shouldn't be the only thing. For example, what actions do they take to combat climate change? Which political campaigns do they contribute to, and why? Do they have internal policies to ensure that everyone is paid equally and fairly across roles? What steps do they take to ensure they avoid contributing to gentrification in their local communities?

But for me, at this time and for this career fair, researching a company's history with immigration officials is what is important to me. I encourage others to make their own lists with issues they care about.

### Why only companies that are going to the career fair?

It shouldn't be! There are many different ways companies interact with the UCSD community. I think we should scrutinize company involvement in all levels - including in student orgs, department sponsorships, and hackathon/event sponsorships. 

### Who are you?

I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹! I'm a UCSD student, 5th year, Computer Engineering major, from Revelle College, about to graduate this December. I'm not some outsider, I'm not looking to cancel anyone, and I'm not a part of an organized political group. I'm just someone who cares about what's happening at the border and want to help in any way I can (which, for now, is starting a conversation in my community about what's happening). 

### Why did you make this list?

Story time: In 2016, when I was a sophomore, I attended SD Hacks at UCSDâ€Š-â€Šmy first hackathon! I had no tech experience, never done a interview, only had a few programming classes under my belt, and I hadn't even met a full-time software engineer in my life. 

In terms of hacking, it was great! I met some really cool people, my team won a prize, and I had a blast.

But, I did have one sour interaction. There were a few companies/organizations that were tabling all weekend, so during a break from coding, one of my teammates and I went to go talk with one of them (I believe it was SPAWAR, but I could be mis-remembering). The representative there chatted with us for a while, about what they do and who they hire. He then started telling some random stories about his work, and at one point he told us a story about how he was working on a project with a border control agency. That project involved doing something at the US-Mexico border, and he said that they had a physical map of the border, and had little figurines on the map to denote specific groups on the mapâ€Š-â€Štheir group and people crossing the border. He said that he had the idea of putting sombreros on the figurines that represented the people crossing the border. He then said that his teammate told that him that the joke was offensive, but he still laughed it off and started laughing again with the other SPAWAR representative at the table.

I laughed along too, because I thought I had no choice. I definitely didn't think he was funnyâ€Š-â€ŠI thought he was a racist asshole. But, at the time, I thought that this was my only opportunity for a software job, so I laughed along and dealt with his stories, hoping to somehow slip my resume to them.

The companies that visit UCSD have a lot of powerâ€Š-â€Špower that we don't talk about a lot, as a community. Yes, they give students jobs and transform our campus with donations and research collaborations. But for many students, they act as the sole representative of entire industries. I thought that all software companies were full of assholes like that representative from SD Hacks. It wasn't until I joined [Code2040](http://www.code2040.org/), met people from other companies, and worked with other engineers did I realize that what happened back then was totally wrong and was not representative on the entire tech industry. 

Yes, only a small handful of companies at the career fair work with ICE in some capacity. But the longer we say nothing and act complicit in their actions, the more comfortable they get and the longer they spend supporting the atrocities that are being committed at the border.
